The vendored folders are that commit, unchanged. The machine builds Vulhub's own Dockerfile in `app/`, unchanged, on top of Vulhub's published image `vulhub/tomcat:8.5` (pinned by tag, as Vulhub does); that image's Dockerfile is vendored under `base/tomcat/tomcat8.5/` to show how it is built. The Dockerfile downloads the application (`ROOT.war`) from file.vulhub.org at build time; the running lab needs no internet.

To update, replace the vendored folders with a newer Vulhub commit, then change this file.
